## [#1873 Calculate Special Bonus](https://leetcode.com/problems/calculate-special-bonus/)
### **Notes**
- Usage of `CASE`:
When multiple possibilities of conditions, we can use [the `CASE` statement](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_case.asp)

```
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    WHEN conditionN THEN resultN
    ELSE result
END;
```

```
SELECT CustomerName, City, Country
FROM Customers
ORDER BY
(CASE
    WHEN City IS NULL THEN Country
    ELSE City
END);
```

- Usage of `NOT LIKE` with `Wildcards` in SQL:
In this case we are looking for words that do not start with a 'M.' Therefore we should use 'M%' with the `NOT LIKE` to include them.

[SQL Wildcards](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_wildcards.asp)

- Usage of remainders:
In this case we are looking for odd numbers, which means it has a remainder of 1 if divided by 2. There are several ways to indicate a remainder statement:
  1. [`MOD` statement](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_mysql_mod.asp):
    ```
    SELECT MOD(9, 2);   // 1, odd number
    ```
  2. `x % y`
    ```
    SELECT MOD(employee_id, 2) != 0
    ```
<!-- more -->

## [#627 Swap Salary](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-salary/)
### **Notes**
- Usage of `UPDATE` statement:

```
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

In this case, we use `CASE...WHEN` to set the column:

```
update Salary
SET
   sex = CASE sex WHEN 'm' THEN 'f'
         ELSE 'm'
         END
```

## [#196 Delete Duplicate Emails](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-duplicate-emails/)
### **Notes**
In this case the solution is to join the table with itself, and filter out the duplicates to be deleted. Ordered by `id`, we can indicate that the duplicate column will have a bigger `id` number than the first one, and a same `email`.

```
DELETE p1 FROM Person p1, Person p2
WHERE p1.Email = p2.Email AND p1.Id > p2.Id;
```

You can also join tables without the `JOIN` statement like this: `FROM Person p1, Person p2`. What we deleted here is the left half of the two tables.
