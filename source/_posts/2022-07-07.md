I got a RaspberryPi long time ago but never had the chance to play with it. Recently I finally started looking into doing some small IoT projects. And before getting into that, with the growing interest of image-processing and scraping and... endless things to learn (ðŸ˜‚), I decide to learn Python, which is also the language recommended by the RaspberryPi developer community.

I have been coding along an Udemy Python course to learn the basics, and want to get familiar with this language as fast as possible. To get my hands dirty, I figure I should expose myself to this language more than just course exercises. Since I have learned some syntaxes and with the problem solving skills I had from my day-to-day experience working with JavaScript, I decided to boost my familiarity of Python with the [Leetcode Beginners Guide]([https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/the-leetcode-beginners-guide/](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/the-leetcode-beginners-guide/)).  

This guide is a good starter with basic data structures. I have come across one of the interesting problem sets, where Python's simplicity surprises me. So here is my solving process for [1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-to-zero/):

### **Observe:**

We should calculate how many steps is needed to reduce a number to zero. The rules are:

- Divide the number by two if itâ€™s even
- Subtract one if itâ€™s odd

### **Find the edge cases or â€˜terminating pointâ€™:**

Once the value of the number hits 0, weâ€™re done. Return the steps needed.

### **Pseudo code:**

```python
0. num == 0 ? True: Go to step 5, False: Go to step 1
1. num % 2 == 1 ? True: Go to step 3, False: Go to Step 3
2. Even: num = num / 2 Go to step 4
3. Odd: num = num - 1 Go to step 4
4. step++ Go to step 0
5. return final steps
```

### **Solution 1 - modulo**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numberOfSteps(self, num):
        """
        :type num: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        times = 0
        while num > 0:
          if (num % 2) != 1:
            num = num / 2
          else:
            num -= 1
          times += 1
        return times

# Time Complexity: O(logN)
# Space Complexity: O(1)
```

Runtime:Â **7 ms**
Memory Usage:Â **13.5 MB**

### **Solution 2 - bitwise operator**

Since we are playing with odd and even numbers, we can use a bitwise operator to solve this one. Actually just changing a lil bit of the code where the modulo was used, and apply the bitmask 1 to num to determine whether num is odd or even:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numberOfSteps(self, num):
        """
        :type num: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        times = 0
        while num > 0:
          if (num & 1) == 0:  // if num bitwise-and 1 is 0, means it's even
            num = num / 2
          else:
            num -= 1
          times += 1
        return times

# Time Complexity: O(logN)
# Space Complexity: O(1)
```

Runtime: **23 ms**
Memory Usage: **13.4 MB**

The other problem sets in this beginner guide are also basic enough to help boosting my confidence and make me feel more comfortable using the language. Starting from here, I can now explore the practical side of the language itself while continuing to learn its applications in different settings.
